## About Me

I am a bilingual (English B2 / Spanish native) software engineer with experience across startups, freelance projects, and product-oriented teams. I have worked extensively with modern JavaScript frameworks, cloud-native architectures, and complex system integrations, especially in payment systems, dashboards, internal platforms, and automation.

I prioritize Clean Code, SOLID principles, and long-term maintainability over short-term hacks. I am comfortable working in SCRUM environments, handling both greenfield projects and legacy refactors, and taking ownership of features end-to-end.
